# Conclusion

FMJ2 has delivered verifiable evidence to the Design World company showcasing a notable improvement in their security posture over the course of the past 16 weeks. FMJ2 would like to suggest that Design World takes immediate action to ensure the ongoing maintenance of the security measures previously implemented by FJM2. As cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, it is crucial to regularly review and update security controls that may no longer be effective. By doing so, Design World can continue to uphold a strong security posture and minimize the risk of potential breaches or attacks. As a result, weekly attacks have decreased significantly, instilling confidence within the organization to transition to a fully remote work environment from a brick-and-mortar operation. This success highlights the dedication and hard work of FMJ2's employees in ensuring a safe and secure working environment.
